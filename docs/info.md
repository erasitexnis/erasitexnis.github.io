### Aristeidis Apladas

<p>I was born in Heraklion (Crete) on January 30th. From a young age, I was fascinated by art in all fields such as painting, music, poetry, photography and cinema. In 2014 I started painting courses at the "A3" school. My studies are combined with courses at the "Psichi" school where I am teached the secrets of art history. My mentors in this art project are Mr. Manolis Apostolakis, Mr. Andreas Kampas and Ms. Efi Foundoulaki.</p>

<p>My art pieces are on canvas, acrylic, with mixed techniques, and typically of dimensions 100 x 160.</p>
